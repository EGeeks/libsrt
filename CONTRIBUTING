Notes:

- By contributing code to the faragon/libsrt project in any form, including
sending a pull request via Github, a code fragment or patch via private email or
public discussion groups, you agree to release your code under the terms of the
BSD license that you can find in the LICENSE file included in the faragon/libsrt
source distribution. You will include BSD license in the LICENSE file within
each source file that you're contributing to.

- Check code formatting (based on a clang-format-5.0 Linux-like template). E.g.

	cd utl
	./format.sh
	git diff

- Ensure your code has no conflicts, and prefer, if possible, to add all the PR
changes in one commit. E.g. you can rebase/squash for grouping commits before
or during the PR. Small changes are likely to be accepted quickly.

- Git comment:
	- Commit title: lowercase start is preferred, check log history for
	examples (you'll find bad examples, too).
	- Commit description: Optional, try to keep things as simple as
	possible, at your option. If adding it, start the text with uppercase,
	e.g. like this file.
	- You're welcome to use a syntax/grammar checker.

- At the end of every commit comment, by using "git commit --signoff", or
manually, add your name and email, so you acknowledge to have read and accept
the CONTRIBUTING/LICENSE terms. E.g.

	Signed-off-by: Lazarus Long <llong@email.example>

	or

	Signed-off-by: L. Long <llong@email.example>
